Class partyInventory is meant to hold items that the player character collects as they progress through the game. Since there are four
subclasses for genericItem, namely items, weapons, armors, and accessories, the code in this class should be able to manage holding 
items from all these subclasses. For the sake of sorting, I believe that there should be four separate inventories for each item type.
