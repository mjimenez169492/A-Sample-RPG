# Text-Based RPG

The project "Text-Based RPG" is my attempt at creating a turn-based role playing game (RPG) presented using graphical user interfaces (GUIs) created esclusively using the Java programming language. This project marks the first time I have ever created GUIs on my own. The code in this project is meant to serve as a base which I or anyone else can use to jumpstart projects centered around game creation. This means that the final form of this project WILL NOT represent the final version of the game that I intend to create by using and changing aspects of the base code.
